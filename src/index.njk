        Named the “poet laureate of the wok” by food historian Betty Fussell, Grace Young has devoted her career to demystifying the ancient cooking utensil for use in contemporary kitchens. Grace has devoted much of her career to preserving the traditional iron wok. With the growing popularity of nonstick cookware, the wok is an endangered culinary tool. She is the first food writer to write extensively about <i>wok hei</i>, the Cantonese term for a stir-fry imbued with the wok’s unique fragrance and flavor. Grace’s translation of <i>wok hei </i>as “breath of a wok,” which she coined in <i>The Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen</i>, is now a part of the Western culinary vocabulary. <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/grace-young-interview-5218099" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><i>Serious Eats </i></a>recently featured Grace in a special profile of her wok collection. In 2004, Grace was a guest curator for <i>The Breath of a Wok</i> exhibition at New York University’s Asian Pacific American Gallery. In 2005 the show traveled to the Portland Classical Chinese Garden in Portland, Oregon.

        <br><br>
